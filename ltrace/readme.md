**ltrace - Library Call Tracing** üîç
---

1. **Explain the technical concept**:

   - **ltrace**: 
     - It's a diagnostic tool in Linux that intercepts and logs the dynamic library calls made by a user-space application and the signals received by that application.
     - This tool is especially beneficial when wanting to understand the interactions an application has with shared libraries.
   
   - **Origin**:
     - The name "ltrace" is derived from "library-call tracing", emphasizing its primary function.

   - **Usage**:
     - `ltrace` can be simply used by prefixing it before the executable. For instance: `ltrace ./executable <parameters>`.
     - This command then outputs all the library calls made by the executable. 

2. **Curious Questions**:

   - **Q**: Why might someone choose to use ltrace over other debugging tools like gdb?
     - **A**: While `gdb` is a comprehensive debugger for inspecting program internals, `ltrace` provides a lightweight and straightforward method to solely trace library calls, which can be quicker and more direct for diagnosing library-related issues.
   
   - **Q**: Can ltrace show system calls like opening files or network connections?
     - **A**: No, `ltrace` focuses on library calls. For system calls, `strace` would be the appropriate tool to use.
   
   - **Q**: Is it possible to filter specific library calls when using ltrace?
     - **A**: Yes, `ltrace` supports several options and filters that allow users to trace specific library calls or exclude certain calls from the trace.

3. **Explain the concept in simple words**:
   
   - Imagine a theatre play where actors constantly go backstage to change their costumes (these represent library calls). üé≠
     - Using `ltrace` is like having a dedicated person noting down every time an actor goes backstage and which costume they pick up. This way, if there's a missing or wrong costume, we can quickly pinpoint the exact moment it went wrong.
