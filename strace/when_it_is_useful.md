**When to Use `strace`** üõ†Ô∏èüïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

1. **Explain the technical concept**:

   - **strace**: 
     - A powerful Linux utility that traces system calls and signals of a specified program. It lets you see "under the hood" of a process, capturing every system-level interaction.
     - It acts as a bridge between applications and the operating system, giving insights into what an application is doing, especially when things go awry.

   - **Applications**: 
     - When traditional debugging methods or log examination yield no clues, `strace` comes in as a detective tool to shine light on issues from a system interaction perspective.

2. **Curious Questions**:

   - **Q**: If a program is hanging and not giving any response, how can strace help?
     - **A**: Using `strace`, you can monitor the system calls the hanging program is making in real-time. If it's stuck in a loop or waiting indefinitely on a particular system call, `strace` will reveal that.

   - **Q**: Can `strace` be used to identify which files a program is trying to access?
     - **A**: Yes, `strace` can show all file-related system calls, such as `open`, `read`, and `write`, allowing you to see exactly which files a program is interacting with.

   - **Q**: Can `strace` impact the performance of the traced program?
     - **A**: Yes, since `strace` intercepts every system call, it can introduce overhead. Hence, it's typically used for debugging rather than in production environments.

3. **Explain the concept in simple words**:

   - Think of `strace` as a security camera üé• for your programs. 
     - If something goes wrong inside a shop, the manager checks the security footage to see what happened. Similarly, if a program is behaving unexpectedly, `strace` gives you a play-by-play of its interactions with the system. 
     - It's like having an inside scoop on every move a program makes, especially when it's not telling you directly what's wrong!
