**Getting the Numbers with `strace`: System Call Statistics** üìäüîç
---

1. **Explain the technical concept**:

   - **System Call Statistics with `strace`**:
     - When profiling or debugging an application, it's often valuable to know which system calls are being made frequently. Frequent system calls might indicate specific operations the program relies on heavily or potential areas of optimization.
     - `strace` offers the `-c` option to provide a summarized view of system calls made during the execution of a program. 

   - **Statistics Provided**:
     - **Call Count**: How many times each system call was invoked.
     - **Error Count**: How many of those calls resulted in an error.
     - **Time Spent**: How much cumulative time was spent on each system call.

   - **Difference between `-c` and `-C`**:
     - `-c`: Displays only the summary of system calls after the program finishes execution.
     - `-C`: Shows the regular `strace` output (i.e., each system call as it happens) in addition to the summary at the end.

2. **Curious Questions**:

   - **Q**: How can frequently made system calls help in profiling an application?
     - **A**: High frequency of certain system calls may point to bottlenecks or operations that the application relies heavily upon. By focusing on optimizing these operations, the overall performance might be improved.
   
   - **Q**: If a system call shows a high error count in the statistics, what does it imply?
     - **A**: A high error count might suggest issues with the application's logic or environmental problems where the program is being executed. It's a signal that that particular operation is failing frequently and warrants investigation.

   - **Q**: Can `strace` be used to get statistics of a running process?
     - **A**: Yes, you can attach `strace` to a running process using the `-p` option followed by the process ID.

3. **Explain the concept in simple words**:

   - Think of a factory assembly line üè≠. Workers (programs) are doing specific tasks (system calls). Some tasks might be done frequently, while others are rare.
     - If you're the manager, you'd want a report (statistics) at the end of the day to see which tasks are being done most often, which tasks had the most issues, and how much time was spent on each task. This report helps in identifying areas for improvement or potential problems. That's what `strace -c` or `strace -C` does for your programs! üìëüìäüìâ.
