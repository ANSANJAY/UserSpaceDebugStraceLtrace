**strace - System Call Tracing** üîç
---

1. **Explain the technical concept**:

   - **strace**: 
     - A diagnostic and debugging tool in Linux that intercepts and records the system calls made by a process and the signals it receives.
     - System calls are the requests made by user-space applications to the operating system kernel for various services, such as reading a file or sending data over a network.

   - **Purpose**:
     - By observing the system calls and signals, users can gain insight into the inner workings of an application, diagnose issues, and understand its interactions with the kernel.
    
   - **Output**:
     - The tool outputs each system call with its arguments and its return value. Errors are especially highlighted with error codes and descriptions.

2. **Curious Questions**:

   - **Q**: Why would you want to use strace instead of a traditional debugger like gdb?
     - **A**: `strace` is specifically tailored for tracing system calls. It's lightweight, and if you suspect an issue is related to system interactions (like file access or network operations), `strace` can give direct insights without the overhead of a full debugger.

   - **Q**: How can strace help in identifying performance bottlenecks?
     - **A**: If an application is making an excessive number of certain system calls (e.g., file reads/writes), `strace` can highlight this, indicating potential optimization areas.

   - **Q**: Can strace show interactions with shared libraries?
     - **A**: No, `strace` focuses on system calls. For tracing library calls, `ltrace` is the tool to use.

3. **Explain the concept in simple words**:
   
   - Imagine you have a magic window ü™ü that lets you see every time someone knocks on a door (makes a system call) in a big building (the operating system). 
     - Each knock is either answered (successful system call) or ignored (failed system call). 
     - Using `strace` is like watching through this window, observing all the knocks and responses to understand what's happening inside.

**Note**: The commands you provided demonstrate how to use `strace` with a given program (`strace program_name`) and how to attach `strace` to an already running process using its process ID (`strace ‚Äìp <pid>`). The output is rich with information that helps in diagnosing various system-related issues an application might encounter.
